## Lessons Learned

During the development of the Solar Survey Website, I gained valuable experience in a number of areas:

### Understanding client requirements

One of the most important lessons I learned during this project was how to effectively understand and meet client requirements. In order to build a website that met the client's needs, I needed to communicate with them regularly, ask clarifying questions, and ensure that I was delivering a product that met their expectations.

### Working with design files

Another area where I gained experience was in working with design files provided by the client. I learned how to effectively translate designs into code, making adjustments where necessary to ensure that the website was both visually appealing and functional. Through this process, I was also able to improve my attention to detail and ability to maintain consistency in the website's design.

### React and TypeScfipt proficiency

The Solar Survey Website was built using React and TypeScript, and through this project, I was able to significantly improve my proficiency in both of these technologies. I gained experience in writing clean, maintainable React components and effectively managing state within the application. I also improved my understanding of TypeScript, including how to use its type system to write safer and more reliable code.

Overall, the Solar Survey Website project provided me with a valuable opportunity to improve my skills as a web developer and gain real-world experience in working with clients and delivering high-quality products.
